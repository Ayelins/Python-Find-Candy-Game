A simple memory game made with Python and Turtle graphics. The goal is to memorize the location of each candy on a 4×4 grid and then find all copies of the candy the game requests after the grid is covered.

## How the game works
1. Click **Start** on the welcome screen.  
2. A 4×4 grid of candies appears for a few seconds.  
3. The candies are covered by black squares.  
4. The game tells you which candy to find (blue, green, red, or purple).  
5. Click the boxes where you think that candy is hidden.  
6. Correct clicks uncover the candy.  
7. When you find all copies of that candy, you move to the next round.  
8. Every 3 rounds, your level goes up.
